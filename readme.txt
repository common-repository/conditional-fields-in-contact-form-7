Adds conditional logic to Contact Form 7.

== Description ==

Adds support for conditional fields to Contact Form 7. This plugin depends on [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/).
If you edit your Contact Form 7, you will see an additional tag called "Conditional fields Group". Everything you put between the start and end tag will be hidden by default.
After you have added the field group(s), click Save and go to the "Conditional fields" tab to create one or more conditions that will make the group(s) appear.

[Demo](https://sovetit.ru/cfcf7).

Advanced users can code up the conditions as plain text instead of using the select boxes, using the import/export feature.
